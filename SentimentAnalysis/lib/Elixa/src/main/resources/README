    + English: 12973 lemma-polarity annotations. 
    + Spanish: 7811 lemma-polarity annotations. 
    + French: 14151 lemma-polarity annotations.

The format of the dictionaries consist of "word \t polarity" and it can be

    + Basque: 63 OOV-Standard_form combinations.
    + English: 7823 OOV-Standard_form combinations.
    + Spanish: 223 OOV-Standard_form combinations.
    + French: 279 OOV-Standard_form combinations.


The format of the dictionaries consist of "OOVword \t standardForm" and they are used for text normalization. 

--------------------------------

- Emoticon polarity lexicon:
    + emoticons.lex: 60 regex-correspondingGroup combinations.
 
Emoticon lexicons is a list of regexes (Java syntax) matching one or more emoticons, mapped into a 5 category schema. The following values are used:

        * KISSEMOT - emoticons matching kisses
        * SADEMOT - emoticons matching sad faces

This emoticons are used at text normalization step as well as as clues for polarity classification.
* IMPORTANT NOTE: it is up to the user to include the elements of this schema in the polarity lexicon and assign them polarities.
